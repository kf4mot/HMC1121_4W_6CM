# HMC1121 4W 6cm
The HMC1121 is a GaAs MMIC 4W power amplifier with an integrated temperature compensated on-chip power detector that operates between 5.5 GHz and 8.5 GHz. The HMC1121 provides 28 dB of gain, 44 dBm output IP3, and 36.5 dBm of saturated output power at 30% PAE from a 7 V power supply.
